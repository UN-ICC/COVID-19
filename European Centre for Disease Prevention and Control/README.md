# ECDC DATASETS

##### Context:

- The 14-day notification rate of new COVID-19 cases, along with the 14-day death rate are the main indicators displayed. These rates are calculated based on data collected by the ECDC Epidemic Intelligence from various sources and are affected by the local testing strategy, laboratory capacity and the effectiveness of surveillance systems. Comparing the epidemiological situation regarding COVID-19 between countries should therefore not be based on these rates alone. At individual country level, this indicator may however be useful for monitoring the national situation over time.
- Testing policies and the number of tests performed per 100 000 persons, vary markedly across the EU/EEA and presumably even more so among third countries. More extensive testing will inevitably lead to more cases being detected.
- The 14-day notification rate of new COVID-19 cases should be used in combination with other factors including testing policies, number of tests performed, test positivity, excess mortality and rates of hospital and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions, when analysing the epidemiological situation in a country. Most of these indicators are presented for EU/EEA Member States in the [Country Overview](http://covid19-country-overviews.ecdc.europa.eu/) report.
- Even when using several indicators in combination, comparisons between countries should be done with caution and relevant epidemiological expertise.

##### Structure:

There are 8 different datasets extracted from the ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) platform. You can find a detailed description of each dataset below or refer directly to the [original source](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/data) for further information.



##### [14_day_age_specific_notification_rate.csv](14_day_age_specific_notification_rate.csv) : 

14-day notification rate of newly reported COVID-19 cases per 100 000 population by age group, week and country. Each row contains the corresponding data for a certain week and country. 

##### Variables:

##### [country_response_measures.csv](country_response_measures.csv) : 

Disclaimer: The data on non-pharmaceutical interventions (or response measures) are based on information available from official public sources, and may not capture measures being taken by countries that are not reported on publicly available websites. The situation is evolving rapidly and this represents a snapshot of the measures that countries in the EU/EEA have reported to date. The response measures displayed are national measures, reported on official public websites. Response measures collected include mass gathering cancellations (for specific events or a ban on gatherings of a particular size); closure of public spaces (including restaurants, entertainment venues, non-essential shops, partial or full closure of public transport etc.); closure of educational institutions (including daycare or nursery, primary schools, and secondary schools and higher education); ‘stay-at-home’ recommendations for risk groups or vulnerable populations (such as the elderly, people with underlying health conditions, physically disabled people etc.); ‘stay-at-home’ recommendations for the general population (which are voluntary or not enforced); and ‘stay-at-home’ orders for the general population (these are enforced and also referred to as ‘lockdown’), use of protective masks in public spaces/on public transport (mutually exclusive voluntary recommendations and mandatory obligations shown separately) and also teleworking recommendations/closure of workplaces.

The data on response measures has several limitations. Firstly, there is substantial heterogeneity in physical distancing policies and their implementation between countries. For instance, the level of enforcement of measures may vary between countries and there may be specific rules and exceptions to the measures, making interpretation of the data challenging. The measures displayed in these figures are measures reported at national level and it should be noted that due to the evolution of the outbreak in certain regions, regional or local measures often preceded national ones. The exact dates of introduction were often available from official sources but delays in their implementation may have occurred. Additionally, availability of public data from official government sources varies among countries. For some countries, data are no longer available on official websites concerning measures that are no longer in force, which may result in the data for more recent measures being more complete

Areas are marked in the following colours: 

- Green if the 14-day notification rate is lower than 25 cases per 100 000 and the test positivity rate below 4%
- Orange if the 14-day notification rate is lower than 50 cases per 100 000 but the test positivity rate is 4% or higher or, if the 14-day notification rate is between 25 and 150 cases per 100 000 and the test positivity rate is below 4%;
