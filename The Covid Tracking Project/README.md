# THE COVID TRACKING PROJECT DATASET

##### Context:

The **COVID Tracking Project** is a collaborative volunteer-run effort to track the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.

##### Variables:

| *Variable*                        | *Description*                                                |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`date`**                        | Date on which data was collected by The COVID Tracking Project. |
| **`state`**                       | Two-letter abbreviation for the state or territory.          |
| **`positive`**                    | Total number of confirmed plus probable cases of COVID-19 reported by the state or territory, ideally per the August 5, 2020 CSTE case definition. Some states are following the older April 5th, 2020 CSTE case definition or using their own custom definitions. Not all states and territories report probable cases. If a state is not reporting probable cases, this field will just represent confirmed cases. |
| **`probableCases`**               | Total number of probable cases of COVID-19 as reported by the state or territory, ideally per the August 5, 2020 CSTE case definition. By this definition, a probable case is someone who tests positive via antigen without a positive PCR or other approved nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), someone with clinical and epidemiological evidence of COVID-19 infection with no confirmatory laboratory testing performed for SARS-CoV-2, or someone with COVID-19 listed on their death certificate with no confirmatory laboratory testing performed for SARS-CoV-2. Some states are following the older April 5th, 2020 CSTE case definition or using their own custom definitions. |
| **`negative`**                    | Total number of unique people with a completed PCR test that returns negative. For states / territories that do not report this number directly, we compute it using one of several methods, depending on which data points the state provides. Due to complex reporting procedures, this number might be mixing units and therefore, at best, it should only be considered an estimate of the number of people with a completed PCR test that return negative. |
| **`pending`**                     | Total number of viral tests that have not been completed as reported by the state or territory. |
| **`totalTestResultsSource`**      | Indicates which field is being used for total test results.  |
| **`totalTestResults`**            | In most states, the totalTestResults field is currently computed by adding positive and negative values because, historically, some states do not report totals, and to work around different reporting cadences for cases and tests. |
| **`hospitalizedCurrently`**       | Individuals who are currently hospitalized with COVID-19. Definitions vary by state / territory, and it is not always clear whether pediatric patients are included in this metric. Where possible, we report patients hospitalized with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases. |
| **`hospitalizedCumulative`**      | Total number of individuals who have ever been hospitalized with COVID-19. Definitions vary by state / territory, and it is not always clear whether pediatric patients are included in this metric. Where possible, we report patients hospitalized with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases. |
| **`inIcuCurrently`**              | Individuals who are currently hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit with COVID-19. Definitions vary by state / territory, and it is not always clear whether pediatric patients are included in this metric. Where possible, we report patients in the ICU with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases. |
| **`inIcuCumulative`**             | Total number of individuals who have ever been hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit with COVID-19. Definitions vary by state / territory, and it is not always clear whether pediatric patients are included in this metric. Where possible, we report patients in the ICU with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases. |
| **`onVentilatorCurrently`**       | Individuals who are currently hospitalized under advanced ventilation with COVID-19. Definitions vary by state / territory, and it is not always clear whether pediatric patients are included in this metric. Where possible, we report patients on ventilation with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases. |
| **`onVentilatorCumulative`**      | Total number of individuals who have ever been hospitalized under advanced ventilation with COVID-19. Definitions vary by state / territory, and it is not always clear whether pediatric patients are included in this metric. Where possible, we report patients on ventilation with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases. |
| **`recovered`**                   | Total number of people that are identified as recovered from COVID-19. States provide very disparate definitions on what constitutes a “recovered” COVID-19 case. Types of “recovered” cases include those who are discharged from hospitals, released from isolation after meeting CDC guidance on symptoms cessation, or those who have not been identified as fatalities after a number of days (30 or more) post disease onset. Specifics vary for each state or territory. |
| **`dataQualityGrade`**            | Quality of the data. 5 grades (A+,A,B,C,D) or N/A if left blank. |
| **`lastUpdateEt`**                | Date and time in Eastern time the state or territory last updated the data. |
| **`death`**                       | Total fatalities with confirmed OR probable COVID-19 case diagnosis (per the expanded CSTE case definition of April 5th, 2020 approved by the CDC). In some states, these individuals must also have COVID-19 listed on the death certificate to count as a COVID-19 death. When states post multiple numbers for fatalities, the metric includes only deaths with COVID-19 listed on the death certificate, unless deaths among cases is a more reliable metric in the state. |
| **`totalTestsViral`**             | Total number of PCR tests (or specimens tested) as reported by the state or territory. The count for this metric is incremented up each time a specimen is tested and the result is reported. If we discover that a jurisdiction is including antigen tests in this metric, we will annotate that state or territory’s data accordingly. For states with ambiguous annotations, we have assigned their total tests to this category; these states and territories are identified in the new API field covidTrackingProjectPreferredTotalTestUnits as having “Unclear units.” |
| **`positiveTestsViral`**          | Total number of completed PCR tests (or specimens tested) that return positive as reported by the state or territory. If we discover that a jurisdiction is including antigen tests in this metric, we will annotate that state or territory’s data accordingly. |
| **`negativeTestsViral`**          | Total number of completed PCR tests (or specimens tested) that return negative as reported by the state or territory. For states/territories that do not report this number directly, we compute it using one of several methods, depending on which data points the state provides. If we discover that a jurisdiction is including antigen tests in this metric, we will annotate that state or territory’s data accordingly. |
| **`positiveCasesViral`**          | Total number of unique people with a positive PCR or other approved nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), as reported by the state or territory. This is equivalent to a confirmed case as per the CSTE case definitions of August 5th, 2020 and April 5th, 2020. If we discover a jurisdiction is labeling cases as confirmed using other evidence (e.g. positive antigen tests), we will annotate that state or territory’s data accordingly. |
| **`deathConfirmed`**              | Total fatalities with confirmed COVID-19 case diagnosis (per the expanded CSTE case definition of April 5th, 2020 approved by the CDC). In some states, these individuals must also have COVID-19 listed on the death certificate to count as a COVID-19 death. When states post multiple numbers for confirmed fatalities, the metric includes only lab-confirmed deaths with COVID-19 listed on the death certificate, unless deaths among confirmed cases is a more reliable metric in the state. |
| **`deathProbable`**               | Total fatalities with probable COVID-19 case diagnosis (per the expanded CSTE case definition of April 5th, 2020 approved by the CDC). In some states, these individuals must also have COVID-19 listed on the death certificate to count as a COVID-19 death. When states post multiple numbers for probable fatalities, the metric includes only probable fatalities with COVID-19 listed on the death certificate, unless deaths among probable cases is a more reliable metric in the state. |
| **`totalTestEncountersViral`**    | Total number of people tested per day via PCR testing as reported by the state or territory. The count for this metric is incremented up by one for each day on which an individual person is tested, no matter how many specimens are collected from that person on that day. If an individual person is tested twice a day on three different days, this count will increment up by three. If we discover that a jurisdiction is including antigen tests in this metric, we will annotate that state or territory’s data accordingly. |
| **`totalTestsPeopleViral`**       | Total number of unique people tested at least once via PCR testing, as reported by the state or territory. The count for this metric is incremented up only the first time an individual person is tested and their result is reported. Future tests of the same person will not be added to this count.  In the case where the state only provides negative cases, this field is calculated as the summation of people who tested positive (“Positive Cases (People”) and the number of people who tested negative (“Negative (People or Cases)”). If we discover that a jurisdiction is including antigen tests in this metric, we will annotate that state or territory’s data accordingly. |
| **`totalTestsAntibody`**          | Total number of completed antibody tests as reported by the state or territory. |
| **`positiveTestsAntibody`**       | Total number of completed antibody tests that return positive as reported by the state or territory. |
| **`negativeTestsAntibody`**       | The total number of completed antibody tests that return negative as reported by the state or territory. |
| **`totalTestsPeopleAntibody`**    | The total number of unique people who have been tested at least once via antibody testing as reported by the state or territory. |
| **`positiveTestsPeopleAntibody`** | The total number of unique people with completed antibody tests that return positive as reported by the state or territory. |
| **`negativeTestsPeopleAntibody`** | The total number of unique people with completed antibody tests that return negative as reported by the state or territory. |
| **`totalTestsPeopleAntigen`**     | Total number of unique people who have been tested at least once via antigen testing, as reported by the state or territory. |
| **`positiveTestsPeopleAntigen`**  | Total number of unique people with a completed antigen test that returned positive as reported by the state or territory. |
| **`totalTestsAntigen`**           | Total number of completed antigen tests, as reported by the state or territory. |
| **`positiveTestsAntigen`**        | Total number of completed antigen tests that return positive as reported by the state or territory. |
| **`fips`**                        | State FIPS code                                              |
| **`positiveIncrease`**            | The daily increase in API field positive, which measures Cases (confirmed plus probable) calculated based on the previous day’s value. |
| **`totalTestResultsIncrease`**    | Daily increase in totalTestResults, calculated from the previous day’s value. This calculation includes all the caveats associated with Total tests/totalTestResults, and we recommend against using it at the state/territory level. |
| **`deathIncrease`**               | Daily increase in death, calculated from the previous day’s value. |
| **`hospitalizedIncrease`**        | Daily increase in hospitalizedCumulative, calculated from the previous day’s value. |
